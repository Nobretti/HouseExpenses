Overthink and create a markdown file for an App that should have a structure for Claude Code following this specs:

- Building a Mobile App and Desktop that could Manage Weekly, Montlhy and Anual Home Expenses with Main Categories and Sub Categories
- Stablish Money Expenses Limits for Each Category and show alert messages when some category passed
- Dashboard with some graphics showing Weekly Monthly and Anual Expenses Progress
- Here are the Categories/SubCategories Defined in a tree format for month expenses:
	- Casa
		- Crédito Habitação
		- Condominio
		- Limpeza
		- Água
		- Elétrecidade / Gás
	- Educação
		- Escola Leonor
		- Mestrado Joana
	- Saude
		- Consultas
		- Farmácias
	- Alimentação / Necessidades
		- Supermercado
		- Restaurantes
		- Take Away
		- Talho
	- Seguros

	- Filhos
		- Roupa

	- Operadores (Internet, Telefone, Televisão, ...)
	- Outros

  And here are the anual expenses:
	- Viagens / Passeios

- Simple Configuration page where Categories/Sub Categories limits could be defined as other relevant options
- User Will be able to insert each Expense individualy or in a Selection List by picking which products and money he/she
has expend on that instant
- Make an UI and UX Pretty and Friendly with Icons of Food, Insurance, House, etc . since this is going to be used by
Families and should be very intuitive and easy to navigate
- Create an authentication mechanism, for SignUp and Login with Email Verification
- Techincal Requirements:
	- Use Different Folders Generation for both Backend and Frontend projects
	- The App is not complex so there is no need to make rock science strategies
	- Use a database like supabase to store data and for authentication with email sending. 
          The data should be stored in a relational database
        - On UI use React Native that could be extended for both Desktop/Mobile/Tablet
	- Use a Centralized Backend Server in Spring Boot that will do all the calculation around money,
	  dashboard predictions and categories/subcategories management
